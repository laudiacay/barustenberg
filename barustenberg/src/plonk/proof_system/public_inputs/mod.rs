/**
 * Public inputs!
 *
 * This is a linear-time method of evaluating public inputs, that doesn't require modifications to any pre-processed
 * selector polynomials.
 *
 * We validate public inputs by using a transition constraint to force every public input's copy permutation to be
 * unbalanced. We then directly compute the 'delta' factor required to re-balance the permutation, and add it back into
 * the grand product.
 *
 * Ok, let's wind back to the start. Let's say we have 'm' public inputs.
 *
 * We reserve the first 'm' rows of program memory for public input validation. For each of these constraints, we
 * *force* the first column's cell to be zero, using a standard arithmetic gate (i.e. w_l[i] = 0 for the first i rows).
 *
 * We then apply a copy constraint between the first two columns in program memory. I.e. for each row, the second cell
 * is a copy of the first, as in w_l[i] = w_r[i].
 *
 * We then apply a copy constraint that maps the second cell to whererever the public input in question is required.
 *
 * This creates an unbalanced permutation:
 * - For the arithmetic constraint to be valid, the first cell must be 0.
 * - But for the copy permutation to be valid, the first cell must be our public input!
 *
 * We make a further modification to the copy permutation argument. For the forced-zero cells, the *correct* permutation
 * term for sigma_1(g_i) would be k.g_i , where k is a coset generator that maps to the second column.
 *
 * However the actual permutation term for sigma_1(g_i) is just g_i.
 *
 * This makes the permutation product, for the targeted zero-value public input cells, equal to 1
 *
 * We use the following notation:
 *
 *   (*) n is the size of a multiplicative subgroup H
 *
 *   (*) g  are the elements of multiplicative subgroup H
 *        i
 *   (*) w     is the i'th witness in column j
 *        i, j
 *   (*) β, γ are random challenges generated by the verifier
 *
 *   (*) σ     are the values of the j'th copy permutation selector polynomial
 *        i, j
 *
 *   (*) k  are coset generators, such that g  . k  is not an element of H, or the coset
 *        j                                  i    j
 *       produced by any other k  value, for all l != j
 *                              l
 *
 * THIS is our normal permutation grand product:
 *
 *        n
 *      ━┳━━┳━ /                       \   /                        \   /                       \
 *       ┃  ┃  | w     +  β . g    + γ |   | w     + β . k . g  + γ |   | w    + β . k . g  + γ |
 *       ┃  ┃  |  i, 1         i       |   |  i, 2        1   i     |   |  i,3        2   i     |
 *       ┃  ┃  | ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ | . | ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ | . |━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ | = z
 *       ┃  ┃  | w     + β . σ     + γ |   | w     + β . σ     + γ  |   | w    + β . σ     + γ  |
 *      i = 1  \  i, 1        i, 1     /   \  i, 2        i, 2      /   \  i,3        i, 3      /
 *
 *
 * Now let's say that we have m public inputs. We transform the first m products involving column 1, into the following:
 *
 *
 *   m                                        m
 * ━┳━━┳━ /                       \         ━┳━━┳━ /               \
 *  ┃  ┃  | w     +  β . g    + γ |          ┃  ┃  | 0 + β . g + γ |
 *  ┃  ┃  |  i, 1         i       |  =====>  ┃  ┃  |          i    | = 1
 *  ┃  ┃  | ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ |          ┃  ┃  | ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ |
 *  ┃  ┃  | w     + β . σ     + γ |          ┃  ┃  | 0 + β . g + γ |
 * i = 1  \  i, 1        i, 1     /         i = 1  \          i    /
 *
 *
 * We now define a 'delta' term that can be publicly computed, which is the inverse of the following product:
 *
 *
 *   m
 * ━┳━━┳━ /                        \
 *  ┃  ┃  | w     + β . g      + γ |
 *  ┃  ┃  |  i, 1        i         |    1
 *  ┃  ┃  | ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ | =  ━
 *  ┃  ┃  | w     + β . k . g  + γ |    Δ
 * i = 1  \  i, 1            i     /
 *
 *
 * i.e. we apply an explicit copy constraint that maps w     to w      for the first m witnesses
 *                                                      i, 1     i, 2
 *
 * After applying these transformations, we have
 *
 *    z  =  Δ
 *     n
 *
 *
 * This can be validated by verifying that
 *
 *  (z(X.g) - Δ).L   (X) = 0 mod Z'(X)
 *                n-1             H
 *
 * We check the n-1'th evaluation of z(X.g), as opposed to the n'th evaluation of z(X), because
 * we need to cut the n'th subgroup element out of our vanishing polynomial Z'(X), as
 *                                                                           H
 * the grand product polynomial identity does not hold at this subgroup element.
 *
 * This validates the correctness of the public inputs. Specifically, that for the first m rows of program memory,
 * the memory cells on the second column map to our public inputs. We can then use traditional copy constraints to map
 * these cells to other locations in program memory.
